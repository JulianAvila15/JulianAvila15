# Profile Description

Hello there! My name is Julian Avila, I am a recent college graduate, majoring in Computer Science and have always been intrigued by opportunities to create
a multitude of software! Here are some of the projects I worked on! 

I have worked on web based games using the Unity game engine in both team settings as well as independently. In teams, I have developed games for a primary purpose, specifically, my team and I have developed games to promote mask safety and to help college students dealing with imposter syndrome feel welcomed at their school. On my own I created a crafting and cooking game to independently study the effects of progress feed back in video games as well. 

Throughout my academic journey I have also learned to build web applications, specifically, through developing ASP.net web pages. One notable project that I have worked on with a group of other students is a Resume Builder for the professional center at Elmhurst University (located in Elmhurst,IL). In tandem to developing the application itself, a SQL database was deployed and created to keep track of the user's information. The database was then extracted from in the application to create the resume with proper formatting. 

Additionally, many of the courses I was required to take as a part of my college's curriculum entailed me solving an abundance of problems and employinbg many different algorithms. Some of which include an AI tile puzzle solver using the A* algorithm, managing threads at the kernel level using C++, and creating a parser for a compiler using C.
